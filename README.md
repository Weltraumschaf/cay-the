# Cay-The

With  this  project  I  play  around   with  [ANTLR4][antlr]  to  create  a  own
programinglanguage. First  for learning purposes,  but second also to  build the
next worlds best programming language ;)

## Research and specifiactions

Why  I'm doing  this?  Since decades  I'm blaming  other  languages for  errors,
faults and shortcommings.  Something my friends always here from  me: If I would
do a programming language I would never do it like this, but that yada yada.

Over time  I looked  into lot of  languages and  read a lot  of stuff  about the
topic.  A dense  contreate about  tht you  can find  in the  paper [the  perfect
progaming languag  e][perfetc-lang] which is part  of this repo. And  if I would
do my own language then it will be like in this [specification][langspec].
