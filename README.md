# Cay-The

With  this  project  I  play  around   with  [ANTLR4][antlr]  to  create  a  own
programinglanguage. First  for learning purposes,  but second also to  build the
next worlds best programming language ;)

## Research and specifiactions

Why  I'm doing  this?  Since decades  I'm blaming  other  languages for  errors,
faults and shortcommings.  Something my friends always here from  me: If I would
do a programming language I would never do it like this, but that yada yada.

Over time  I looked  into lot of  languages and  read a lot  of stuff  about the
topic. A dense  concetrate about that you can find  in the [paper][perfetc-lang]
which is part  of this repo. And if I  would do my own language then  it will be
like in this [specification][langspec].
